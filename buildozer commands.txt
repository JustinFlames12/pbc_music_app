NOTE: Change cmd prompt to 'wsl' and be in same directory as project before starting

1) buildozer init

NOTE: Make revisions/edits in the buildozer.spec file as necessary (i.e. changing the 'title', 'package name'; adding libraries to application requirements; adding name of png file to presplash and icon filename section, changing application versioning number)

2) buildozer -v android debug

OPTIONAL (ONLY FOR DEBUGGING)

NOTE: In windows cmd, cd to directory that has adb.exe. Then plug phone into PC and open the app on the phone

1) adb logcat

NOTE: The command above should track all outputs from the phone and the app

Troubleshooting:

For errors regarding "gradle", try doing the following:

1) Add the following lines to the gradle.tmpl.properties file located in the .buildozer directory (or its descendants):
    org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xms512m -Xmx4g
    org.gradle.caching=true

2) In the build.tmpl.gradle file, try removing the jcenter() lines and replace them with mavenCentral().
